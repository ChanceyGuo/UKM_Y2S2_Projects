UKM_Y2S2_Projects

This repository contains three independent Data Science projects completed in Year 2 Semester 2 at UKM.  
Projects A and B are projects for the Machine Learning (TTTC2453) course;  
Project C is for the Text Processing and Analysis (TTTP2043) course.  

This is my very first repository for storing projects—I had never realized the importance of using GitHub to archive my work until now.

Quick Start
1. Clone this repo:
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/UKM_Y2S2_Projects.git  
2. Enter a project folder:
     cd UKM_Y2S2_Projects/ProjectA    (or ProjectB, ProjectC)  
3. Install dependencies:
     pip install -r requirements.txt  
4. Follow that project’s README for data setup and notebook instructions.

Projects Overview
- ProjectA: Stroke Prediction with ML & DL  
  Predict stroke risk using traditional ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) and a simple neural network.

- ProjectB: IMDB Sentiment & Jena Climate Forecasting  
  Build RNN/LSTM models for sentiment analysis on IMDB reviews and time-series forecasting on Jena climate data.

- ProjectC: COVID-19 Tweet Sentiment & Topic Modeling  
  Clean and label COVID-19 tweets, visualize word clouds, and perform LDA topic modeling on positive and negative tweets.
